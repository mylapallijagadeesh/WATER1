<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em>Water</em>&nbsp;(ISSN 2073-4441) is an international and interdisciplinary open-access journal covering all aspects of water, including water science, technology, management and governance. It publishes original research papers, critical reviews, data descriptor and short communications. There is no restriction on the length of the papers.<br><br>Full methodical and/or experimental details must be provided for research articles. We encourage scientists to publish their research in as much detail as possible. Computed data or files regarding the full details of the experimental procedure or model set-up, if unable to be published as part of the main manuscript, can be deposited as supplementary material.</p>
