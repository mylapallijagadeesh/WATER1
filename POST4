<p>The water cycle describes where water is on Earth and how it moves. Water is stored in the atmosphere, on the land surface, and below the ground. It can be a liquid, a solid, or a gas. Liquid water can be fresh or saline (salty). Water moves between the places it is stored. Water moves at large scales, through watersheds, the atmosphere, and below the Earth’s surface. Water moves at very small scales too. It is in us, plants, and other organisms. Human activities impact the water cycle,&nbsp;affecting where water is stored, how it moves, and how clean it is.</p>

<p>Oceans store 96% of all water on Earth. Ocean water is saline, meaning it’s salty. On land, saline water is stored in saline lakes. The rest of the water on Earth is fresh water. Fresh water is stored in liquid form in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/water-science-school/science/freshwater-lakes-and-rivers-and-water-cycle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">freshwater lakes</a>, artificial reservoirs,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/water-science-school/science/freshwater-lakes-and-rivers-and-water-cycle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rivers</a>, and wetlands. Water is stored in solid, frozen form in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/water-science-school/science/ice-snow-and-glaciers-and-water-cycle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ice sheets and glaciers, and in snowpack</a>&nbsp;at high elevations or near Earth’s poles. Water vapor is a gas and is stored as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/water-science-school/science/atmosphere-and-water-cycle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">atmospheric moisture</a>&nbsp;over the ocean and land. In the soil, frozen water is stored as permafrost and liquid water is stored as soil moisture. Deeper below ground, liquid water is stored as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/water-science-school/science/groundwater-storage-and-water-cycle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">groundwater</a>&nbsp;in aquifers. Water in groundwater aquifers is found within cracks and pores in the rock.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What drives the water cycle?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Water moves naturally and because of human actions. Energy from the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/water-science-school/science/sun-and-water-cycle" target="_blank">sun</a>&nbsp;and the force of gravity drive the continual movement of water between pools. The sun’s energy causes liquid water to evaporate into water vapor. Evapotranspiration is the main way water moves into the atmosphere from the land surface and oceans. Gravity causes water to flow downward on land. It causes rain, snow, and hail to fall from clouds.&nbsp;</p>

The amount of water that is available depends on how much water there is in each pool (water quantity). Water availability also depends on when and how fast water moves (water timing) through the water cycle. Finally, water availability depends on how clean the water is (water quality).
